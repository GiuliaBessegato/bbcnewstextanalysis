## Trust in global news
### Sentiment analysis of BBC articles
---
### What the project does
Sentiment analysis is performed on news articles of a global news corporation, the BBC, making room for both negative and positive emotions. In addition to this, other complementary aspects of the texts will be considered, such as the topics of the articles and a deeper analysis of different emotions beyond the negative and positive labels.

### Dataset
2225 documents from the BBC news website corresponding to stories in five topical areas from 2004-2005. Natural Classes: 5 (business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech)

If you make use of the dataset, please consider citing the publication:
